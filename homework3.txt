Object-Oriented Programming 
Week 3 Extra Practice

In the UK, Easter always falls on a Sunday, but the date depends on the lunar cycle. There are various algorithms to determine when Easter falls each year. You can find some here:

And another one here:

https://www.drupal.org/project/nameday/issues/1180480

In the Day class, write a method which calculates the date of Easter for the year specified in the given object, using one of these algorithms. It should return a new Day object for that date. Test it out against a calendar.
